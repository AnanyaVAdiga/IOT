In existing system, they use robots to extinguish the fire accidents but robots have its own advantages and disadvantages. In this system we go for detection and Monitoring of forest fires through several sensors.
Forest fire is getting worse for all these days which can be detected and predicted using NodeMCU based on IoT. In this project, a temperature sensor, DTH11 humidity sensor is interfaced to NodeMCU detects the temperature and humidity produced from the fire. Using threshold value, the temperature and humidity value is taken into consideration and an analysis is made to detect fire. When it is detected, an email triggered with an alert message with the sensor values and the fire is predicted.
